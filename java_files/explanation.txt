One need to illustrate something about the JAVA programingHow to run .java files in terminal:
    1.entering as:
         javac (-source 1.8) XXX.java
      Then there will be a new file end with .class, which means that you have compile succseefully.
    2.The most confusing manipulation:
      note that there is package information at the beginning of the .java file, one need to first return back to the ”package的上一级目录“
     entering as:
         java (-ea) package.XXX(the classname without .class)
    3.For instances: as for me, we may enter as:
         java Java.HelloWorld

We would like to introduce some basic tools for tracing the GC process:
    1. jstat -gc <vmid>
    2. jvisualvm/jconsole/jmc(open "Java Mission Control.app")
    3. -XX:+PrintGCDetails
    4. -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC
    5. -verbose:gc
